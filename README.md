## A mobile-friendly email template compatible with Gmail 

This email is designed to be sent via Thunderbird or Outlook through Gmail servers. 

This template makes extensive use of tables and inline CSS for two reasons: (1) I had trouble with embedded CSS when sending through Gmail (even if the email was composed in Thunderbird), and (2) the Gmail web interface (for recipients) is limited the type of markup and styling that it will accept and display.
