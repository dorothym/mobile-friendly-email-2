## A mobile-friendly email template compatible with Gmail 

This email is designed to be sent via Thunderbird or Outlook through Gmail. When you send an email via Gmail, CSS that is not inline is stripped out. 

This code is also limited by what can be displayed for recipients using the web Gmail interface. This led me to extensive use of tables and inline CSS.
